# Introduction React Hooks

The above two applications is part of our blog where we explain the challenges in React and how React Hooks overcome those challenges. 

For better demonstration, we have built two apps - 

1. Weather app

This application demonstrates the basic syntax difference between React Class and React Hooks

2. Drag and Drop app

This application demonstrates how to make reusable logic between the components and the difference between

1. React class components
2. Higher-order component
3. React Hooks
